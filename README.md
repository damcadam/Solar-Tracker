The goal of the Solar-Tracker project was replicate solar panels that track the sun using an Aduino Nano and a servo. During daylight (from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM), the arm of the servo will point towards any bright light source. If there is not a light source brighter than a certain theshold, the servo position is based on the time of day. After 6:00 PM the sun is considered to be down, so the servo moves to the 0 degree position to anticipate the rising sun. An LCD connected to the Arduino will always display the servo angle and the clock time.
